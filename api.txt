Guide to the Overproduced API:

Intro: all APIs are built on top of the API in MTG farming written by PilzAdam and others
Bush API built off of bush code in default in MTG

All attributes with an * asterisk before them are optional and have defaults

Melon API:


The register_melon function creates a plant that grows to a maximum size dictated by steps, but if harvested at max drops no seeds. Instead it has an abm to grow melons (also generated by the function) in the blocks next to it
Some notes on this:
	-Diagonal blocks are excluded
	-Melons cannot spawn anywhere other than "air"
	-Melons cannot spawn on top of water or any node without the "normal" drawtype
	if rng picks a location that does not meet the latter two conditions (obviously it doesn't try for diagonal), it just skips spawning and the timer resets

overproduced.register_melon("overproduced:sample", {
	--Normal register_plant api but with a few options
	melon_tiles = {}, --You can define the textures of the melon node the way you normally would
*	interval = 20, --interval for the abm in seconds. By default 180
*	chance = 5, --1 in x chance for the abm to fire. By default 2. Using defaults the abm has a 50% chance of firing every 3 mins. Whether a node is created is dictated by its surroundings

Bush API registers a bush with the same behavior as in MTG

overproduced.register_bush(name, {
	--Modname and plantname are sliced from name, it should be "modname:plantname"
*	bush_with_fruit = "String" This is the interal name for the bush with fruit. Defaults to "modname:bush_leaves_with_plantname" Will concat with modname
*	bush_without_fruit = "String" This is the internal name for the bush without fruit. Defaults to "modname:plantname_bush_leaves" Will concat with modname
*	bush_with_fruit_desc = "String" Description for the bush leaves with fruit. By default, "Plantname Bush Leaves with Berries"
*	bush_texture = "String" Full filename for the texture for the bush without berries. Defaults to "modname_plantname_bush_leaves.png"
*	overlay_texture = "String" Full filename for the fruit texture to be overlayed on the bush. Defaults to "modname_plantname_overlay.png"
*	drop = "String" Full itemname for what item the plant should drop. Defaults to nothing. Should be able to include a drop table
