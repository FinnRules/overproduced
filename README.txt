Overproduced Mod!

Goals:
	-Create a mod with a wide variety of crops, and eventually foodstuffs to craft from them
	-Create useful APIs that go beyond that of "farming" in MTG. These include
		-overproduced.register_plant: beefed out and more versitile version of farming.r_p
		-overproduced.register_melon: create pumpkins and melons
		-overproduced.register_bush: bushes with fruit on them, function form of the blueberry bush code in "default"
			-More info in api.txt
	-Be independent of default and farming, but include optional dependency
		-No hoe mod will be included to avoid reinventing the wheel, but farming isn't required for the mod to run
		-Will eventually include optional integration for mobs from ElCeejo's better_fauna
